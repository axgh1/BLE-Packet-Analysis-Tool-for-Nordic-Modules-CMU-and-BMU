This repository contains a Python-based BLE packet analysis tool for Nordic nRF52840-DK modules CMU and BMU. The tool can be used to analyze ".log" files of BLE packets exchanged between the two modules and generate visualizations such as connection event count histograms over BLE 37 channels, RSSI boxplot over BLE 37 channels, and error graphs.

The tool uses Python libraries such as matplotlib, pandas, and numpy for data visualization and analysis. The tool can help developers and researchers working with Nordic nRF52840-DK modules CMU and BMU to better understand the quality of their BLE communication.
